1. Update the playbook `httpd.yml` to add a play that will fetch the OS version from all the hosts in the inventory file (inventory file is in lab3). Use the `debug` module.
2. Using the `lineinfile` module, create a text file in the /home/username directory and write the contents: "This is an ansible generated file." Write a playbook that does this.
3. Create a user on the localhost using `user` module with username: `localuser`, uid : 1040 and group: `developers`
